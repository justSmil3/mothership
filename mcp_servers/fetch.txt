"A Model Context Protocol server that provides web content fetching capabilities. This server enables LLMs to retrieve and process content from web pages, converting HTML to markdown for easier consumption.\nThe fetch tool will truncate the response, but by using the \nstart_index\n argument, you can specify where to start the content extraction. This lets models read a webpage in chunks, until they find the information they need.\nfetch\n - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.\nurl\n (string, required): URL to fetch\nmax_length\n (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return (default: 5000)\nstart_index\n (integer, optional): Start content from this character index (default: 0)\nraw\n (boolean, optional): Get raw content without markdown conversion (default: false)\n"
